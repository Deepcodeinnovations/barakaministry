								<hr/>
								<p><b>Passport: </b> A valid passport is required for entry into Uganda. Please make sure that your passport is not expired.</p>  

<p><b>Visa: </b>A single entry visa is required for entry into Uganda. An entry visa for United States, Canadian and Mexican citizens can be obtained at the Entebbe airport in Uganda, upon your arrival. We are suggesting that everyone on the team proceeds this way. You will need to present your passport, your medical card showing you have been vaccinated for yellow fever, and US $50 at the visa desk at the airport to receive your visa.</p>

<p><b> Vaccinations: </b>  All team members must receive a Yellow Fever vaccination prior to leaving your country.  Consult with your physician on other recommended vaccinations.</p>

<p><b>Medications:</b> It is strongly recommended that all team members take anti-Malaria medication as a preventative.</p>

 <p><b>Spending Money:</b> All of your hotels, safari, meals, and transportation expenses are covered in the cost of the trip.  Your only out-of-pocket expenses will be for additional food, beverages, or souvenirs, and US $50 for your visa upon arrival.  There will be opportunities on the trip to purchase souvenirs. We suggest bringing US$100-300 in cash or travelerâ€™s checks, also, one major credit card for emergency.</p>

 <p><b>Exchanging money:</b>  For the best rate and easiest method of exchanging money you will need to bring US$100 bills dated 2003 or newer for exchange.</p> 

 <p><b>Emergency Medical Insurance: </b>We strongly encourage you to purchase trip insurance.  The travel agent offers both medical and trip insurance for cancellation.  If you have your own, please feel free to use what works best for you.</p>

 <p><b>Emergency Contact Information: </b>Please provide the team leader with a contact name and phone number for us to contact on your behalf in case of an emergency.</p>
<p><b>
 Luggage: </b>Each team member is limited to one piece of check-in luggage weighing not more than 50 lbs and one carry-on.

								<div class="post_descr">
									<p> Dress: As a general rule, dress should be modest, but comfortable.  We recommend light weight clothing. It will be warm and humid. Rain is also a good possibility at times. Men, in particular, should plan to bring ample shirts. With the exception of church services on Sunday, men can wear comfortable slacks or jeans, t-shirts or light-weight short sleeve shirts. Women can wear comfortable slacks or pants for free time and non-ministry activities, however long dresses or capris are appropriate when engaged in ministry.  Shoes should also be comfortable. Tennis shoes/walking shoes would be appropriate. Sandals if durable and water proof, due to the possibility of rain and mud. For church on Sunday, the Ugandan people will come wearing their best. Women should wear a full-length sundress. (No pants). Men should wear slacks, and a dress shirt. Ties are recommended but not required.</p>
