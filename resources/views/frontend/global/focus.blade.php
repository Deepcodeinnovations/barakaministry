Since then we have continued taking in children though at a moment we just locate them beautiful God-fearing families that can host them but still under our care. We are doing what we can to get the funding and partnership to enable us build homes for these kids, baby’s homes, clinic, school, sports facilities and a farm to make the organization more self-sustainable, doing what we can for each individual and their family as the Lord allows us.</p>
