                    Baraka Ministries is an evangelical, non-denominational, Bible-based ministry that believes that the Holy Scripture is God’s own word written by men as the Holy Spirit inspired them. It is an infallible record of God’s self-disclosure to mankind. The Scriptures are the authoritative and normative rule and guide of all Christian life, practice and doctrine. (2 Peter 1: 20 –21; 2 Tim 3:16-17)

                <p>We believe that there is one God, eternal, infinite, perfect and unchangeable</p>
                <p>We believe that there is but one God, eternal, infinite, perfect and unchangeable. God is one in His essential being, but in this one being there are three persons called Father, Son and Holy Spirit. (Gen 1:26; 11:7; Matt 28:19; Luke 3:21, 22; John 14:16)</p>
                <p>We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ is God. He became man when conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary (Isaiah 7:14; Matt 1:18) in order that He might redeem the sinful man. Christ became man without ceasing to be God. Christ redeemed man by voluntarily giving himself as a sinless sacrifice on the cross, a perfect atonement to satisfy God’s judgment against sin. (Matt 20:28; John 1: 29; Rom 3:25)</p>
                <p>We believe that the Holy Spirit is the giver of life, convicts the world of guilt, in regard to sin, righteousness and judgment (John 16:8-11). Through the proclamation of the Gospel, He persuades men to repent of their sins and confess Jesus as Lord. He gives birth to new life and dwells in the life of those born again. (John 3:5-6). The Holy Spirit has come to glorify the Son, who in turn came to glorify the Father. He leads the believer into understanding the truth and application of God’s word. (John 14:15-17, 25, 26)</p>
                <p>We believe that one is saved by the grace of God and not by character, law or good works</p>
                <p>We believe that the Holy Spirit is the active agent in our sanctification who seeks to produce His fruit in us (Gal 5:22-23). Though indwelling sin remains a reality, the Spirit of God comes to lead to knowledge of the Lord. In addition to regeneration and sanctification, the Holy Spirit also empowers believers to serve the body of Jesus Christ. While all believers are indwelt by the Holy Spirit at conversion, the scriptures clearly show the growing empowerment of the Spirit.</p>
                <p>We believe that one is saved by the grace of God and not by character, law or good works. The death and resurrection of Christ are adequate for the salvation of all and offered to all. However, salvation is appropriated only by faith in Christ. Those who repent and believe in Christ as Savior and Lord are born again adopted into the family of God and receive the gift of eternal life. (John 3:16; Rom 3:21-25)</p>
                <p>We believe that the same Jesus who ascended to heaven (Acts 1:9-11) will come back. Those dead in Christ will resurrect from the rest of the dead, and the living believers who will be alive at the time of His coming shall be caught up in the air to join Christ. (1 Thess 4:13-18)</p>
                <p>We believe in the resurrection of both the saved and the lost; the saved to the resurrection of eternal life and the lost to the resurrection of damnation and eternal punishment. (Rev 20:11-15; I Cor 15:51-57)</p>
                <p>We believe in the spiritual unity of believers in our Lord Jesus Christ and that all true believers are members of His body, the Church</p>
                <p>We believe in the spiritual unity of believers in our Lord Jesus Christ and that all true believers are members of His body, the Church. We therefore believe that every believer should be a faithful member of a local church. (Eph 1:22-23; I Cor 12:12, 27)</p>
                <p>We believe that the ministry of evangelism is a responsibility of both the church and each Christian. We are therefore called upon by the Lord to be His witnesses in both deeds and word of mouth. (Rom 10:9-15; Acts 1:8; Matt 28:18-20; I Peter 3:15)</p>
